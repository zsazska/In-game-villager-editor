Commands:

/trigger villager_getselector       Get the selector item (right-click a villager to select it)
/trigger villager_professionmenu    Set the selected villager's profession (This will only work if the villager already has trades)
/trigger villager_typemenu          Set the selected villager's type
/trigger villager_tradeproperties   Modify the properties of the trades

If the villager's trade menu closes immediately when you open it, select the villager and use the "/function trade:others/fixvillager" command


How to use:

Select a villager by right-clicking it with the selector (Selected villagers glow). This will spawn a chest and an armor stand at your location. There are 3 slots in the chest (2 on the left and 1 on the right). The slots on the left are what the villager buys and the slot on the right is the item the villager sells. You can put any items in these slots (Leaving them empty will cause the villager to sell and buy air. Use the red dye in the middle of the chest to delete trades). Once you're done, click the lime dye to save your changes. This will also save changes you've made in the trade properties menu. To discard your changes, simply remove the selector from your offhand. Any armor or head put on hte armor stand will also be put on the villager. Changing a villager's armor, type or profession doesn't have to be saved, and they won't be discarded if you remove the selector from your offhand.
